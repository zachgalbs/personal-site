                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                
                <p>
                    The modern world presents us with unprecedented complexity and choice. Traditional approaches to work, creativity, and decision-making often prove inadequate for navigating this landscape. At the same time, we have access to tools and knowledge that enable new forms of systematic thinking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This site explores the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. It's one thing to read about productivity systems or brewing techniques; it's another to implement them consistently in real circumstances with real constraints.
                </p>

                <h3>Core Questions</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>How can systematic approaches enhance rather than replace human judgment?</li>
                    <li>What works in practice versus what works in theory?</li>
                    <li>How do we balance optimization with sustainability?</li>
                    <li>When should we follow systems and when should we abandon them?</li>
                    <li>How can we maintain curiosity while building reliable processes?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These questions don't have universal answers, but exploring them in specific contexts reveals patterns and principles that often generalize to other domains.

                <h2>Approach</h2>
                
                <p>
                    The methodology here draws from several traditions:
                </p>

                <h3>Scientific Method</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Form hypotheses about what might work</li>
                    <li>Design experiments to test specific claims</li>
                    <li>Measure results objectively when possible</li>
                    <li>Document both successes and failures</li>
                    <li>Iterate based on evidence</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Engineering Mindset</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Optimize for specific constraints and requirements</li>
                    <li>Consider trade-offs and limitations</li>
                    <li>Build for reliability and maintainability</li>
                    <li>Focus on what works, not what's theoretically optimal</li>
                    <li>Embrace practical compromises</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Craftsperson Tradition</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop skill through deliberate practice</li>
                    <li>Understand tools and materials deeply</li>
                    <li>Value process as much as outcome</li>
                    <li>Seek mastery through repetition and refinement</li>
                    <li>Learn from both success and failure</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Content Philosophy</h2>
                
                <h3>Specificity Over Generality</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Rather than broad principles, the focus is on specific implementations tested in specific contexts. General advice is often useless; specific examples can be adapted to different circumstances.
                </p>

                <h3>Process Over Product</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The thinking behind decisions is often more valuable than the decisions themselves. By documenting reasoning, assumptions, and constraints, others can evaluate whether similar approaches might work in their contexts.
                </p>

                <h3>Honest Reporting</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Failed experiments and abandoned approaches are documented alongside successes. This provides a more complete picture and helps others avoid repeating ineffective strategies.
                </p>

                <h3>Practical Focus</h3>
                
                <p>
                    All content is grounded in actual practice. Theoretical frameworks are included only when they prove useful for guiding real-world decisions and actions.
                </p>

                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                
                <h3>Site Design</h3>
                
                <p>
                    This site is built using pure HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. The design prioritizes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Typography optimized for sustained reading</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Fast loading, minimal dependencies</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Works without JavaScript, screen reader friendly</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Low energy consumption, minimal server requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Simple technologies that remain stable over time</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The visual design draws inspiration from academic papers, technical documentation, and book typography. The monochrome palette eliminates visual distraction while the generous whitespace provides breathing room for complex ideas<span class="sidenote-mark" data-content="The design philosophy aligns with Dieter Rams' principles of good design: innovative, useful, aesthetic, understandable, unobtrusive, honest, long-lasting, thorough, environmentally friendly, and as little design as possible."></span>.
                </p>

                <h3>Content Management</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Content is maintained in plain HTML files with minimal structure. This approach:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reduces complexity and potential failure modes</li>
                    <li>Enables easy backup and version control</li>
                    <li>Allows direct editing without specialized tools</li>
                    <li>Ensures content remains accessible regardless of platform changes</li>
                    <li>Supports fast, reliable deployment</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sidenotes System</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The sidenotes feature is implemented using progressive enhancement:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Works without JavaScript (falls back to inline notes)</li>
                    <li>Positions notes in margin on wide screens</li>
                    <li>Collapses to expandable inline notes on mobile</li>
                    <li>Maintains readability across all device sizes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This technical approach reflects the broader philosophy: start with solid basics, then enhance without breaking core functionality.
