                <h2>Northgard</h2>
                <p>
                    A Viking-themed RTS that I've been really into lately. I usually play against my brother in the duel mode. There's something satisfying about like keeping track of your village and figuring out the fastest way to develop.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Minecraft Bedwars</h2>
                <p>
                    My go-to game when I have a limited amount of time and my brother is willing to play. There's something addictive about the fast-paced PvP combined with the strategic components. Figuring out whether to go to the diamond gen straight away or get a stone sword before, stuff like that. I've gotten pretty decent at duels with my brother, often to the point where he only wants to play with a friend on his team. We use bedwarspractice.club.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Zelda</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm replaying Breath of the Wild since the Switch 2 upgrade just came out. It's a really nice relaxing game. The physics and visual aesthetics are amazing. I often struggle to decide between helping the poor villagers with their issues and making actual progress.
